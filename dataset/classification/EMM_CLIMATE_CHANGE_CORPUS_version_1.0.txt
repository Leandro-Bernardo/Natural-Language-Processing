But CO2 is not a pollutant and it is not a poison and we should not corrupt the English language by depriving pollutant and poison of their original meaning. Our exhaled breath contains about 4% CO2. That is 40,000 parts per million, or about 100 times the current atmospheric concentration. CO2 is absolutely essential for life on earth. Commercial greenhouse operators often use CO2 as a fertilizer to improve the health and growth rate of their plants.	3_3
Contrary to what some would have us believe, increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will benefit the increasing population on the planet by increasing agricultural productivity	3_3
We are all aware that the green revolution has increased crop yields around the world. Part of this development is due to improved crop varieties and better use of mineral fertilizers and herbicides. But no small part of the yield improvement may have come from increased atmospheric levels of CO2. Plants photosynthesize more carbohydrates when they have more CO2.	3_3

Carbon dioxide is plant food that doesnt harm anybody except that it might include temperature increases.	3_3
Corals, trees, birds, mammals, and butterflies are adapting well to the routine reality of changing climate	3_2

Warmer temperatures are also helping the country bring back the Greenland cod, a pivotal species whose total disappearance in the early 1990s was caused by overfishing and a four degree Celsius drop in the water temperatureand which deeply affected the countrys economy. Now that the seas around Greenland are at the highest temperatures since 1960s, cod are making their way back home, and some Greenlanders are reaping the rewards.	3_2
latest research demonstrates that in the short term, at any rate the temperature feedbacks that the IPCC imagines will greatly amplify any initial warming caused by CO2 are net-negative, attenuating the warming they are supposed to enhance. His best estimate is that the warming in response to a doubling of CO2 concentration, which may happen this century unless the usual suspects get away with shutting down the economies of the West, will be a harmless 1 Fahrenheit degree, not the 6 F predicted by the IPCC.	3_1
Negative climate feedback loops have beneficial results. Instead of continued warming, they spark a favorable chain of events that lessen the severity of climate change. Here are examples of negative feedback mechanisms for climate change: Increased cloudiness reflects more incoming solar radiation	3_1
Climate models used by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assume that clouds provide a large positive feedback, greatly amplifying the small warming effect of increasing CO2 content in air. Clouds have made fools of climate modelers. A detailed analysis of cloud behavior from satellite data by Dr. Roy Spencer of the University of Alabama in Huntsville shows that clouds actually provide a strong negative feedback, the opposite of that assumed by the climate modelers. The modelers confused cause and effect, thereby getting the feedback in the wrong direction	3_1
Even this modicum of warming may never be realized, however, for it could be negated by a number of planetary cooling forces that are intensified by warmer temperatures and by the strengthening of biological processes that are enhanced by the same rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration that drives the warming. Several of these cooling forces have individually been estimated to be of equivalent magnitude, but of opposite sign, to the typically predicted greenhouse effect of a doubling of the air's CO2 content, which suggests to me that little net temperature change will ultimately result from the ongoing buildup of CO2 in Earth's atmosphere. Consequently, I am skeptical of the predictions of significant CO2-induced global warming that are being made by state-of-the-art climate models and believe that much more work on a wide variety of research fronts will be required to properly resolve the issue.	3_1
Negative feedback refers to a cause and an effect, with the effect either inhibiting or limiting the occurrence of future causes. For example, when body temperature gets too high, humans will sweat. This sweat cools the body, preventing any more overheating from happening. Many deniers claim that negative feedback mechanisms will prevent the climate from becoming too warm.	3_1
"in physics (and in nature) the tendency is just the opposite: a "negative feedback" will occur as CO2 levels rise in other words, cooling mechanisms will set in. In the case of carbon dioxide and global temperature, "future CO2 has less impact on temperature than past CO2," he says."	3_1

this latest research adds further proof to the unpredictability of the supposed effects of global warming and the Antarctic is actually growing and all the evidence in the last few months suggests many assumptions about the poles was wrong. He said that Global sea ice is at a record high, another key indicator that something is working in the opposite direction of what was predicted and there is a huge inconvenience that reality is now catching up with climate alarmists, who were predicting that the poles would be melting fairly soon.	1_1
Antarctica's ice isn't melting like we thought. A new study using NASA data shows it's melting in ebbs and flows, rather than consistently, which could mean we need to change models around sea level rise.	1_1

According to the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre in Colorado, Arctic summer sea ice has increased by 409,000 square miles, or 26 per cent, since 2007 and even the most committed global warming activists do not dispute this.	1_1
This situation seems to be stable, suggesting that the melting under the ice shelf does not increase. The findings, a rare bit of good news after worrying signs in recent years of polar warming, adds a small bit to a puzzle about how Antarctica is responding to climate change - blamed largely on human use of fossil fuels.	1_1
Sea water under an East Antarctic ice shelf showed no sign of higher temperatures, first tests showed today. Despite fears of a thaw linked to global warming that could bring higher world ocean levels, tests conducted on the Fimbul Ice Shelf showed the sea water is still around freezing point. Thanks to sensors, lowered through three holes drilled in the shelf, scientists have discovered the water is not at higher temperatures widely blamed for the break-up of 10 shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula, the most northerly part of the frozen continent.	1_1
