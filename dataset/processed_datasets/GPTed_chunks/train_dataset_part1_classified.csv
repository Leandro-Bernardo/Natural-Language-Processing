When a solar cycle is much prolonged, as the last one was, records of previous solar cycles show that subsequent cycles tend to be pronouncedly inactive.

The striking feature of this recovery pattern consists of a higher solar energy yield and higher GISP2 temperatures compared to the temperature level given for the date of any impact.

"With increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, there is an imbalance in energy flows in and out of the earth system at the top of the atmosphere (TOA): the greenhouse gases increasingly trap more radiation and hence create warming (Solomon et al. 2007; Trenberth et al. 2009). Warming really means heating and extra energy, and hence it can be manifested in many ways. Rising surface temperatures are just one manifestation. Melting Arctic sea ice is another. Increasing the water cycle and altering storms is yet another way that the overall energy imbalance can be perturbed by changing clouds and albedo. However, most of the excess energy goes into the ocean (Bindoff et al. 2007; Trenberth 2009). Can we monitor the energy imbalance with direct measurements, and can we track where the energy goes? Certainly we need to be able to answer these questions if we are to properly track how climate change is manifested and quantify implications for the future.",SUBJ,0_0

"The most important recent scientific work concerns the Global Climate Models (GCM). Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas in that it absorbs outgoing radiation on particular wavelengths, with a resultant warming effect. However, looking at carbon dioxide alone, any effect would be quite small. To get to the predictions of doom, and thus to justify the destruction of industrial civilization, one must build computer GCMs based on the assumption that a small initial effect of carbon dioxide is amplified by positive feedback mechanisms. A score of such models exist, all of which assume that feedback is positive, and that in consequence a small amount of carbon dioxideinduced warming will indeed trigger an upward cascade in temperature. No empirical support for this assumption exists, and if it is erroneous and thus there is no positive feedback, then the effects of carbon dioxide become negligible.",SUBJ,3_1

That argument then continues that additional infrared radiation from anthropogenic greenhouse gases can only add to surface evaporation, and cannot heat the oceans. On the other hand, sunlight reaches into the oceans to depths of 100 meters or so, though most of it is absorbed in the top 10 meters. Even so, sunlights ability to warm the oceans is many orders of magnitude greater than infrared radiation. One of my earliest memories of this argument came from Robert E. Stevensons (Oceanographer Scripps) 2000 article Yes, the Ocean Has Warmed; No, Its Not Global Warming .

Such causality assertions require a validated theory that higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations cause increases in GAST. Lacking such a validated theory, EPAs conclusions cannot stand.
