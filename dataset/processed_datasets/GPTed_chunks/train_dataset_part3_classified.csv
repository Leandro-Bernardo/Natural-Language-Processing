"These disclosures highlight a key fact with respect to global temperature data: the data sets are utterly lacking in integrity. Global warming alarmists confidently announce that worldwide temperatures have risen by, say .1 degree over a decade. It would be extraordinarily difficult to take measurements at many locations around the globe that would actually demonstrate that proposition. But the real situation is much worse: no one tells you what temperatures were actually measured at the worlds weather stations. Rather, they report claims of global warming based on adjusted temperature dataadjusted by alarmists, with the systematic purpose of manufacturing a rising temperature trend. If you subtract the adjustments, it may well be that there has been no net warming over the last 100 years at all.",OBJ,5_1

"In natural sciences, knowledge is obtained by validating the content of one's mind according to the facts of reality. Truth then corresponds to reality. In philosophy the world is largely artificial, and truth is redefined to mean coherence among ideas much along the views of the philosopher Immanuel Kant. Hence a dogma can be constructed by ignoring reality, and rather appealing to authority or consensus as invalid substitutes for reason. In philosophy hypotheses can be proposed, validated, and accepted without reference to facts (Sanford, 1992).

Given that over the course of the next 1030 years the magnitude of natural decadal variations may rival that of anthropogenically forced climate change on regional scales, it is envisioned that initialized decadal predictions will provide important information for climate-related management and adaptation decisions. Such predictions are presently one of the grand challenges for the climate community. This requires identifying those physical phenomenaand their model equivalentsthat may provide additional predictability on decadal time scales, including an assessment of the physical processes through which anthropogenic forcing may interact with or project upon natural variability. Such a physical framework is necessary to provide a consistent assessment (and insight into potential improvement) of the decadal prediction experiments planned to be assessed as part of the IPCCs Fifth Assessment Report.",OBJ,0_0

By measuring tree rings for an individual tree you are not measuring the overall tree growth of the area. And measuring 10.000 trees does not change anything as all trees would have the same problem. Measuring tree pollen or isotopes etc in sediment cores avoids these problems and it makes me wonder how come so much energy has been used for tree ring analyses.,OBJ,5_1

"Reservations among member governments continued at the meeting of environment ministers on March 2. Environment Daily reported, At a ministerial meeting in Brussels environment minister Altero Matteoli made a prolonged attempt to force a declaration from his colleagues that future emission-cutting action should depend on the treaty being ratified by Russia and thus entering into force. The move follows increasing unrest in Italian industry circles at the imminent prospect of the greenhouse gas curbs under the EU climate emissions trading system. The Italian government first reflected this last December when it tried to characterize Kyoto explicitly as a threat to business at a summit of EU leaders.""",SUBJ,0_0

"In the end, the most rational thing for the country to do on GHGs is for Congress to enact legislation that gets EPA out of the GHG regulatory business entirely. Even proponents of GHG regulation dont believe that the CAA is suited to that purpose. We must therefore keep pushing on the legislative front, since new legislation is the right thing to do. Still, the alignment of political forces is such at this time that comprehensive GHG legislation seems out of reach, although more targeted legislative approaches may be possible. Without some intercession from Congress, we are left with possibly decades of hand-to-hand combat on GHG regulation.",SUBJ,0_0

"El Nio and La Nia events typically peak in strength in December and January. Refer to Figure Intro-1. Its a graph of the weekly sea surface temperature anomalies for the NINO3.4 region of the eastern equatorial Pacific, starting in 1990. The sea surface temperature anomalies of the NINO3.4 region are an often-used index of the frequency, strength and duration of the El Nio and La Nia events. The El Nio events appear as the large upward spikes (warmings) in the sea surface temperature anomalies, and La Nias show themselves as the downward spikes (coolings). As youll note, they normally peak in December and January.",OBJ,0_0

"Shlaes offers a new gloss on the old theme of how FDR used the Depression to craft the durable New Deal coalition. Here her narrative sparkles, as she recounts how FDR transformed the failures of his economic policy to his political advantage in the 1936 election. The failure of the New Deal to deliver meaningful economic growth lent paradoxical validity to FDR's class-warfare rhetoric: Many in the country believed that the United States was actually becoming the society of social classes that Roosevelt now described in his speeches. And they responded accordingly,"" that is, by re-electing Roosevelt. The secret was purposely dividing people into interest groups, and pandering to enough of them to create a majority.""",SUBJ,0_0
