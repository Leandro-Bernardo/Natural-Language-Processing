They claim that, up to 1950, it explained over 50 percent of temperature variation; then, CO2 became 90 percent of the cause of change. Part of the reason for downplaying irradiance is the low percentage of change in modern records. The earliest record from outside the atmosphere from a manned observatory was Skylab (19731979). Skylab showed a change of 0.14% in the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI). An average over time shows a variation of 0.1% for an 11 year sunspot cycle.

What is evident is that there has been a very disciplined temperature decline over the last four thousand years. The whole temperature record is bounded by two parallel lines with a downslope of 0.3C per thousand years. The fact that no cooling event took the Dye 3 temperature below the lower bounding green line over nearly four thousand years is quite remarkable.

This observation suggests that rates of starch synthesis can influence rates of photosynthesis. Thus, as the CO 2 content of the air continues to rise, the enhanced ability of plants to synthesize starch from increased photosynthetic products should allow them to maintain their higher rates of photosynthesis, which ultimately should stimulate their growth and biomass production.",SUBJ,3_3

We store our carbonated soft drinks, wine, and beer in a cool place to prevent them from loosing their fizz, which is a feature of their carbonation, or CO2 content.

"The trauma caused by two planes crashing into the Twin Towers has made us forget that al Qaeda and its associates have a maritime strategy more sophisticated than blowing up the USS Cole. Before his arrest, the man responsible for the Cole attack himself had undertaken preparation to attack shipping in the Mediterranean with a four pronged-strategy: ramming, blowing up medium-size ships near other vessels or at ports, attacking large vessels such as supertankers from the air by using explosive laden small aircraft, and attacking vessels with underwater demolition teams using limpet mines or with suicide bombers. During his interrogation, Nashiri revealed that if warships became too difficult to approach, tourist ships could be targeted. The cruise ship industry, which in the U.S. alone carries nearly seven million passengers every year, is facing this new threat.""29""",OBJ,0_0

Because pika live no longer than 7 years, (averaging 3 to 4 years in the wild), there is constant turnover at each site. A site remains vacant until a young pika, driven from another territory, randomly scampers into that vacancy and claims ownership. Without knowing how often a talus pile alternates between occupied and vacant, simply reporting observations of a vacant site tells us nothing about 1) why it is vacant, 2) when it was vacated, and 3) if it will soon be recolonized. Unfortunately vacancies have been misleadingly called extinctions.

"More importantly, climate models suffer from the limitations of current scientific understanding of the forces that determine weather patterns and climate change. Climate modelers cannot avoid making assumptions about the operation and effects of such key variables as water vapor, clouds, ocean-atmosphere interaction, solar cycles, ocean currents, and the natural carbon cycle. Those assumptions are fraught with uncertainties and may be little better than educated guesses. It is not surprising, therefore, that the models have been notoriously poor at replicating current and past climate. For example, the models that served as the scientific background for the 1992 Rio Treaty implied that the world should have warmed 1.5 C since the late 19th century. In fact, surface measurements indicate the world has warmed only 0.5 C. The models were off by a factor of three.",SUBJ,5_1
