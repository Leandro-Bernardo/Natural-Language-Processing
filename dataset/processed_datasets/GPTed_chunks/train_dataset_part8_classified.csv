"An interesting feature of the models is that almost all show greater year-to-year variability than observations (Fig. 1.) The average model annual variance (detrended) of anomalies is 60 percent greater than that of the observational datasets. This is a clue that suggests the models atmospheres are more sensitive to forcing than is the real climate system, so that an increase in greenhouse forcing in models will lead to a greater temperature response than experienced by the actual climate system. But saying the climate models are too sensitive only identifies another symptom of the issue, not the cause.",OBJ,5_1

In reality this is a forecast of no increase in global temperatures above current levels. If the latest Met Office prediction is correct, and it accords far more closely with the observed data than previous predictions, then it will prove to be a lesson in humility.

"Elevated CO 2 suppressed foliar injury caused by elevated O 3 , especially in some of the more O 3 -sensitive cultivars used in this study. In addition, atmospheric CO 2 enrichment to 700 ppm almost completely protected such cultivars from the negative effects of elevated O 3 on seed yield. At ambient CO 2 concentrations, for example, elevated O 3 reduced seed yield by 48% in an O 3 -sensitive cultivar. However, at an atmospheric CO 2 concentration of 700 ppm, yield reductions in this same O 3 -susceptible variety were only 8%. Thus, atmospheric CO 2 enrichment had a strong ameliorating effect on the negative influences of elevated O 3 on growth and yield of O 3 -susceptable winter wheat cultivars.",OBJ,3_2

"Because hurricanes form over warm ocean water, it is easy to assume that the recent rise in their number and ferocity is because of global warming. But that is not the case, scientists say. Instead, the severity of hurricane seasons changes with cycles of temperatures of several decades in the Atlantic Ocean. The recent onslaught is very much natural,"" said William M. Gray, a professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University who issues forecasts for the hurricane season.""",OBJ,1_7

It represents an indirect attack on prosperity rather than a full-frontal assault. It essentially says, ""I support growth, but "" with emphasis on the ""but.""

"SM: I think you'll have a hard time arguing against Alan Greenspan's record. One of the reasons we've had such spectacular growth over the last decade has been really a spectacular monetary policy. Now, there've been some errors in the last year or so that have caused too much tightening of the economy. But, for the most part, when it comes to monetary policy, you can't beat price stability. We want a policy where the dollar is as good as gold and is the world currency, and that's what's happened under Greenspan's regime. I would have to give him very high marks, although I like his record a lot more than I like his rhetoric.",SUBJ,0_0
