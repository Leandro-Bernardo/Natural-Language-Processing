Atmospheric CO 2 enrichment did not significantly affect leaf water, sugar, protein, or nitrogen contents. Thus, these CO 2 -induced changes in leaf chemistry (higher starch and tannin and lower cyanoglycoside concentrations) increased its palatability, as indicated by greater leaf dry weight consumption of CO 2 -enriched leaves by butterfly larvae. In addition, increased leaf consumption (of CO 2 -enriched leaves) led to greater larval biomass and shorter larval developmental times, indicating that atmospheric CO 2 enrichment affected leaf quality to positively influence larvae of the Common Blue Butterfly. Moreover, larval mortality was lower when feeding upon CO 2 -enriched, rather than ambiently-grown, leaves. What it means",OBJ,3_3

This is easily seen in Figure 4-41. It compares NINO3.4 sea surface temperatures (not anomalies) for the period of January1995 to January 2005 and also the series of base year cycles in the sea surface temperatures for the Western Equatorial Pacific (5S-5N, 120E-165E) and the NINO3.4 region.

"Tide gauge records are the primary source of sea level information over multi-decadal to century timescales. A critical issue in using this type of data to determine global climate-related contributions to sea level change concerns the vertical motion of the land upon which the gauges are grounded. Here we use observations from the Global Positioning System for the correction of this vertical land motion. As a result, the spatial coherence in the rates of sea level change during the 20th century is highlighted at the local and the regional scales, ultimately revealing a clearly distinct behavior between the northern and the southern hemispheres with values of 2.0mm/year and 1.1mm/year, respectively.

"A second possibility is a long-term decrease in middle and upper tropospheric humidity, and no increase in convective mixing. In this case, daytime mixing would bring down the lower humidity air to the surface from the same altitude as before.

If real, such a decrease might well result in negative water vapor feedback, since a small decrease in mid- and upper tropospheric humidity can have a natural radiative cooling effect which outweighs the warming from a larger increase in lower tropospheric humidity (e.g. Spencer and Braswell, 1997 ; Miskolczi, 2010 ).

Much of the recent large rise in the income received by the top 1 or 10 percent results from the Federal Reserve's policy of lowering interest rates and raising housing and stock prices. Higher stock prices increase the incomes of those who own shares. Middle-income earners do not have large stock or bond portfolios. Their shares are mainly part of corporate pension plans. The rise in stock prices benefits the middle class by increasing the support for their future pensions. But the gain is part of their wealth and not part of their current income.

"We live on an ocean-covered planet, yet somehow the hows, the whens, the wheres, and the extents of the warming (and cooling) of the surfaces of our oceans seem to have eluded climate modelers. For the past few years, we have been presenting how poorly the climate models (used by the IPCC) simulate sea surface temperatureslong-term comparisons (example here ) and for the satellite-era. But in those cases, we presented modeled and observed sea surface temperature anomalies . In this post, we presented satellite-era sea surface temperatures, not anomalies, and this has pointed to other climate model failings, which further suggest that simulations of basic ocean circulation processes in the models are flawed.",OBJ,5_1

Computers cannot take responsibility, so presumably it is the government, through lack of due diligence, that is responsible for the expensive and ineffective actions it is now implementing to combat the alleged human-induced dangerous global warming or climate change.

"First, 74% of all U.S. stations are adjusted, while only 37% of ROW stations are adjusted. This is a statistically significant difference by any measure. Is this because the ROW stations are, on average, located in more rural settings than in the US? Or is it because of a difference in methodology (or metadata)? While no one to my knowledge has carried out the engineering-quality investigations necessary to resolve the matter, my impression is that the US has made a fairly concerted effort to maintain weather stations in rural settings (Orland, Miles City etc.) and that many ROW stations are in cities and small towns (especially airports). Using a consistent apples-and-apples population classification, I would be very surprised if this very large difference between U.S. and ROW classifications held up.",SUBJ,5_1
