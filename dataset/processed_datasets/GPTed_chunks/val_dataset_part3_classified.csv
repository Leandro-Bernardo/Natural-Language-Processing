Yes, since 1980, per capita electricity consumption in California has remained flat while it has increased in most other states.

As California's economy and population have grown, so have the state's aggregate electricity consumption and emissions. Today, California consumes 65 percent more electricity than it did in 1980. Coal-based electricity imports from other states grew by 60 percent from 1983 to 2005, and is now 10 percent of California's total generation, growing from 9 percent in 1983.

When the winds shift, that thicker ice is blown out past Svalbard into the north Atlantic, and is replaced by thinner, first-year ice that more readily melts each summer.

"So what do the satellites show? Since the mid-1970s the satellite data show no trend either up or down in outgoing long wave radiation.

The average value of outgoing long wave radiation through the last nearly four decades is about 232.5 watts per square meter. As stated above, there has been very little long term variation in this number since 1974. However, during that time carbon dioxide has increased from 330 parts per million to 392 parts per million today, an increase of 62 parts per million. The pre-industrial revolution carbon dioxide base line value is about 280 parts per million. Since then we have seen a rise of 112 parts per million.

"Some 30 states will have to slash their power plant CO2 emissions by more than 32% and at least 12 will have to implement 40-48% reductions. That is a tall order, since all those states now get 50-96% of their electricity from coal, and all of them depend on coal plus natural gas for nearly all their electric power. Imposing that transition and a conversion to 20% or more expensive and unreliable wind and solar energy by 2030 will be disastrous. It will bankrupt families, businesses, industries, communities and even states.",OBJ,4_1

"So how did Katharine come to the opposite conclusion? I contacted her to find out, and she kindly told me she had used 1965 as the starting point for her analysis. As the graph clearly shows, 1965 was in the middle of a much cooler interlude which lasted from about 1960 to 1985. Since 1985 temperatures have recovered to the sort of levels seen between 1920 and 1960. Indeed the average temperature during the last decade is very slightly lower than the average of the last 100 years and the last two winters have been much cooler than normal.",SUBJ,1_4

"A recent article in Science, Arrow et al., provides a summary of and supporting example for the declining discount rate argument. However a close reading of both the Science article and Wietzman's original article reveals just how critical, and arguably contrived, are the assumptions needed to justify declining discount rates. Nevertheless, even with the assumptions ceded, declining discount rates cannot be used with the IAMs as set up in the IWG's analysis. The low discount rates that motivate DDRs require extended periods of stagnant growth; and the growth rates used by the IWG in the IAMs are too high to meet this criterion.",OBJ,0_0
