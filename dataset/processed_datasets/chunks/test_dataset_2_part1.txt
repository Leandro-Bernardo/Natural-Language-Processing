"People concerned that manmade greenhouse gas emissions, in particular carbon dioxide (CO2), may be causing dangerous climate change worry such a change may disrupt the hydrosphere, which comprises all of the water on Earth and in its atmosphere. This disruption, they argue, would lead to increased rainfall and erratic weather patterns that would greatly increase sea level and produce potentially devastating consequences.A report from the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), an independent group of some 50 scientists from 15 countries, titled Climate Change Reconsidered II: Physical Science, summarizes a large body of research disputing these claims and finds the hydrosphere has exhibited only mild volatility over the past century in concert with natural climate cycles and with no correlation to human CO2 emissions.The data show short-term precipitation volatility is not correlated with either CO2 emissions or general climate warming. For example, monsoon intensity displayed no increase later in the century despite increased CO2 emissions, but instead was correlated with solar activity.In addition, monsoons were generally more intensive during the Little Ice Age (LIA) than the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), which runs directly contrary to the alarmist claims. On the other end of the volatility spectrum, CCR-II disputes the strength of the commonly cited connection between global warming and droughts, as evidenced by the similar rates of drought occurrence in the LIA and MWP.As with precipitation, CCR-II finds no significant connection between sea level or ocean temperature and human CO2 emissions. Sea level is determined by a multitude of factors, and CO2-induced global warming is a minor one. Ocean temperatures have remained virtually unchanged for nine years, according to data of the Argo buoy network.CCR-II found numerous problems with the consensus view of sea-level change. The global sea level has increased by an average of only 12 mm annually over the century, with a wide range of intra-year volatility between +5mm and -5mm away from the mean. Supposed instances of environmental harm caused by sea-level rises, such as coral reef destruction, are often the result of unaccounted alternative factors.Concern over manmade greenhouse gas emissions has been the impetus for many destructive public policies, including renewable portfolio standards, alternative energy subsidies, and high gasoline taxes. Yet, despite ever-increasing levels of CO2 emissions, scientists have been unable to demonstrate a connection to its alleged effects, such as hydrosphere alteration, over the previous century. CCR-II's findings demonstrate precipitation and ocean activity have little to no connection to human CO2 emissions. Therefore, energy production, the lifeblood of the global economy, should not be hindered by state intervention to reduce CO2 emissions.The above introduction was based on text from Climate Change Reconsidered II: Physical Science and its Summary for Policymakers, published by the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC).The following documents provide additional information about the hydrosphere and oceans. Chapter 6 of Climate Change Reconsidered IIhttp://heartland.org/media-library/pdfs/CCR-II/Chapter-6-Hydrosphere-Oceans.pdfIn Chapter Six of Climate Change Reconsidered II: Physical Science, Willem de Lange and Robert M. Carter find little evidence for an overall increase in global precipitation during the twentieth century independent of natural multidecadal climate rhythms. Summary for Policymakers of Climate Change Reconsidered IIhttp://heartland.org/media-library/pdfs/CCR-II/Summary-for-Policymakers.pdfThe IPCC claims to know, apparently with rising certainty over time, that most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations"" (IPCC AR4 SPM, p. 10). This Summary for Policymakers summarizes and interprets Climate Change Reconsidered II, a major scientific report that refutes this claim. More IPCC Misdirection: Its Dodgy Sea Level-Rise Assessmenthttp://www.cato.org/blog/more-ipcc-misdirection-its-dodgy-sea-level-rise-assessmentPatrick J. Michaels and Paul C. Knappenberger of the Cato Institute criticize the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's analysis of sea-level changes in a September 24, 2013 blog post. The authors point out the IPCC cherry-picks data clumps that coincide with their conclusions, while ignoring broader data that contradict them. For instance, the IPCC attributes the recent abnormally high increases in sea level to a new long-term trend, even though the rate of increase has already begun to decline to normal levels, thereby indicating this period was just another short-term cyclical increase. Precipitation Measurements and Trends in the Twentieth Century http://heartland.org/policy-documents/precipitation-measurements-and-trends-twentieth-centuryA research paper published in the International Journal of Climatology in 2002 presents the trends in precipitation over the last century. Global precipitation increased by only 9 mm per year over the century, despite enormous short-term volatility of up to 40mm. Short-term variability can be attributed to natural climate cycles, including reoccurring ENSOs, Arctic Oscillation, and Antarctic Oscillation. The authors admit global precipitation measurement is still primitive and not wholly reliable. Little Change in Global Drought Over the Past 60 Yearshttp://heartland.org/policy-documents/little-change-global-drought-over-past-60-yearsIn this paper published in 2012 in Nature, Justin Sheffield, Eric F. Wood, and Michael L. Roderick cast doubt on the supposed connection between global warming and the frequency of droughts over the past 60 years. The standard analysis used to estimate global moisture levels is highly flawed and underestimates moisture levels, they note. In reality, global moisture levels have barely changed, and by extension, theories that blame hydrosphere changes on global warming are also flawed. Research Explores Hidden Benefits of Intensive Rainfall in East Africahttp://phys.org/news/2012-11-explores-hidden-benefits-intensive-rainfall.htmlMaggie Clune looks at a new study published in 2012 in Nature Climate Change, which demonstrates some benefits of increased rainfall. Generally, climate scientists tend to focus on only the negative effects of climate change while ignoring the positive results it produces. One of these is that increased rainfall replenishes freshwater sources more often. This makes underwater aquifers, rivers, streams, etc. more bountiful, especially in technologically less-developed regions that are heavily dependent upon natural water sources, such as Central Africa. Indian Monsoon Variability in a Global Warming Scenariohttp://heartland.org/policy-documents/indian-monsoon-variability-global-warming-scenarioA paper published in 2003 in Natural Hazards applies to real historical data the IPCC's theory that global warming increases monsoon intensity. The researchers determined there is no correlation between monsoon intensity and global warming. Monsoon strength naturally oscillates along decade-long time intervals regardless of carbon production. Furthermore, increased global temperatures have no effect on intra-cycle variability.

"The most impressive thing about this summer's vaunted droughtcalled an ultra-drought"" by CBS icon Dan Ratheris that it wasn't one. Whereas Rather called this a ""summer to survive"" in the Midwest, it actually looked more like a summer to grow.Illinois experienced what is at least its third-wettest June (records go back to 1895). Toward the end of June, the entire state of Illinois, 90 percent of Missouri and Wisconsin, and half of Iowa were reporting unusually moist conditions. We think that qualifies as the ""Midwest.""But why should we be surprised by this spate of climate hyperbole? That kind of drought hype is about as repetitive as Vice President Al Gore saying ""risky."" Last summer, for example, we were bombarded with the same story, even though less of the country than normal was experiencing a significant moisture shortage. Both the ostensible drought and forecasts of more of the same were based upon the appearance of La Nia (unusually cold) conditions in the tropical Pacific.Going back just another year, recall the agricultural disasters predicted because of El Nio, the warm phase of this common Pacific oscillation. One major network featured brown cornstalks and a cloud of dust in August. That was in Texas, where corn is normally brown in August, given that it's planted early in the year. As for the dust, it was kicked up by a harvester plucking fat ears.The beating goes on and on. And what we find most interesting is that people continue to eat. Well and cheaply, we might add. What gives?Let's stipulate that supply and demand determine price. For food, the latter is increasing because there is a larger number of demanding mouths to feed. Everything else being equal, the price of food should increase slightly as a result of that. But adding in the effect of the 2000 drought, the 1999 drought, the 1998 drought, and so forth should be as calamitous as the Network News.In an attempt to verify all these terrible stories, we plotted out the price of corn in dollars per bushel, allowing for inflation. What is immediately obvious is that the price of corn is lower than it has ever been. Despite all the weather gloom and doom, as well as the population increase, the relative supply of the most important crop produced by the most important agricultural nation in history must be increasing.Our greener pals keep blaming us for the fact that Americans just don't seem to care about global warming. But perhaps they ought to look in the mirror. Constantly hawking weather disasters has a way of losing its credibility in the face of agricultural abundance.It is absurd to conflate warming with food shortages. The corn yield history was virtually steady for the first half of the twentieth century, followed by a dramatic rise in the second half. Today, one acre of land produces almost four times as much corn as it did 100 years ago.During that same time, U.S. temperatures varied considerably from year to year and decade to decade. Obviously, there is little if any correspondence between the nation's temperatures and its crop yields.What warming the United States has seen in the last three decades has been primarily in winter and, within that season, largely confined to the coldest air massesa prediction from greenhouse theory that the climate Cassandras rarely tout. A temperature change of this sort is beneficial for crops because it lengthens their growing season.Another benefit for crop production is the ever-increasing atmospheric level of carbon dioxide. We can certainly assert with confidence that the presence of additional carbon dioxide is responsible for about 10 percent of this abundant harvest.The evidence is in. Today's climate is a boon to agricultureno matter what you may hear on the evening news.ReferencesMichaels, P.J., et al., 2000. Observed warming in cold anticyclones.

"The Kyoto Protocol, even if implementeUT Sf where evidence lies of an impact that only occurred some 12,800 years ago, barely time for a deep breath geologically, the Younger Dryas Impact proponents respond with an extremely weak mumbling about air blasts, asteroid clusters and ice sheet impacts that left no evidence of a large chunk(s) of space debris hitting the Earth.

"Now, the average of this system, the whole atmosphere and surface included together, is what should have the global average temperature of -18 degrees C, and it does, because the temperature goes from warm (+15 degrees C) at the bottom of the atmosphere, to cold (-70 degrees C) at the top of the atmosphere, and measured from space it is -18 degrees C on average. The bottom of the atmosphere is warmest because that is where the Sun does the real-time physical heating in the first place. The temperature decreases with altitude because the heat dissipates outwards from the ground and cools down, and also because of the natural adiabatic gradient. The amount of water vapour in the air-column reduces the adiabatic gradient and it also reduces night-time cooling, because of latent heat which is trapped and then released by the H2O molecules. -And to be sure, those H2O molecules wouldnt be able to get into the air-column if sunshine was freezing cold at -18 degrees C!- Finally, the natural existence of the adiabatic gradient (that is, the fact that the air has to cool with altitude), means that the bottom of the atmosphere must be warmer than top and therefore the bottom must also be warmer than the average. If the average has to be -18 degrees C, then this average has to be found between the bottom (warmest) and the top (coldest), and the bottom will naturally be warmer than that average.

"Fresh doubt has been cast on evidence for global warming following the discovery that a key method of measuring temperature change has exaggerated the warming rate by almost 40 percent. Studies of temperature records dating back more than a century have seemed to indicate a rise in global temperature of around 0.5C, with much of it occurring since the late 1970s. This has led many scientists to conclude global warming is under way, with the finger of blame usually pointed at man-made emissions of such greenhouse gases as carbon dioxide.Now an international team of scientists, including researchers from the Met Office in Bracknell, Berkshire, United Kingdom, has found serious discrepancies in the temperature measurements, suggesting that the amount of global warming is much less than previously believed.Measuring water, not airThe concern focuses on the temperature of the atmosphere over the oceans, which cover almost three-quarters of the Earth's surface. While scientists use standard weather station instruments to detect warming on land, they have been forced to rely on the crews of ships to make measurements over the vast ocean regions.Crews have taken the temperature by dipping buckets into the sea or using water flowing into the engine intakes. Scientists have assumed there is a simple link between the temperature of seawater and that of the air above it.However, after analyzing years of data from scientific buoys in the Pacific that measure sea and air temperatures simultaneously, the team has found no evidence of a simple link. Instead, the seawater measurements have exaggerated the amount of global warming over the seas, with the real temperature having risen less than half as fast during the 1970s than the standard measurements suggest.Reporting their findings in the influential journal Geophysical Research Letters, the scientists say the exact cause of the discrepancy is not known. One possibility is that the atmosphere responded faster than the sea to cooling events such as volcanic eruptions.A big cutThe findings have major implications for the climate change debate because sea temperature measurements are a key part of global warming calculations. According to the team, replacing the standard seawater data with the appropriate air data produces a big cut in the overall global warming rate during the last 20 years, from around 0.18C per decade to 0.13C.This suggests that the widely quoted global warming figure used to persuade governments to take action on greenhouse gas emissions exaggerates the true warming rate by almost 40 percent. The team is now calling for climate experts to switch from seawater data to sea-air temperature measurements.One member of the team, David Parker, of the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research at the Met Office, said the discovery of the discrepancy shows we don't understand everything, and that we need better observations--all branches of science are like that."" Yet according to Parker, the new results do not undermine the case for global warming: ""It is raising questions about the interpretation of the sea-surface data.""Even so, the findings will be seized on by skeptics as more evidence that scientists have little idea about the current rate of global warming, let alone its future rate. Climate experts are still trying to explain why satellites measuring the temperature of the Earth have detected little sign of global warming, despite taking measurements during supposedly the warmest period on record.Some researchers suspect the fault may again lie with the ground-based temperature measurements. They say many of the data come from stations surrounded by growing urban sprawl, whose warmth could give a misleading figure. A study of data taken around Vienna, Austria, between 1951 and 1996 found that the air temperature rose by anything from zero to 0.6C, depending on precisely where the measurements were made.Robert Matthews is a staff reporter for the UK Telegraph, with whose permission this article is reprinted.""",,5_1

"The International Energy Agency (IEA) has released an interesting (if somewhat dry and lengthy) report, World Energy Outlook Special Report 2016; Energy and Air Pollution. I recently discussed the report on an every-other-Monday debate I participate in on CBC's flagship business program The Exchange. As I mentioned in that discussion, I welcome this report, as it directs the world's attention to what I believe, and have always believed, is a huge source of human suffering and environmental degradation.Conventional air pollution (soot, acidic chemicals, ozone) on the scale seen in developing countries causes massive suffering, sickness and death.Fixing that should be a global priority.Yet we have, in recent years, been so focused on climate change impacts in the distant future, that we have lost focus on the reality that conventional pollution is killing millions of people today. According to the IEA, 6.5 million premature deaths every year are attributable to air pollution. The new IEA report makes it fairly clear that where we really need to focus, especially in developing countries, is on conventional pollutants: particulate matter, ozone-forming chemicals and acidic gases such as Sulphur dioxide, with greenhouse-gas reductions being seen as a co-benefit.Another welcome aspect of this report is that it seems pragmatic, shying away from revolutionary all renewables"" language, and simply talking about moving to energy production that is less polluting, which realistically speaking involves natural gas, nuclear and hydro power. It also involves some very low-hanging fruit such as installing catalytic converters in vehicles, installing bag-houses and scrubbers on power plants, and switching from coal to natural gas, hydro and nuclear power generation.The report also emphasizes the importance of universal electricity access, and universal access to clean cooking fuels, which are crucial elements of human and environmental protection and empowerment.Of course, as with all things, one has to balance many factors, including the economic. As the IEA report notes, we know how to control conventional air pollution, but it's not without costs. And given that poverty is also a major cause of morbidity and mortality (probably the largest cause). So, phasing in air protections without breaking the economic engines of development is important.And there are always things to quibble about in a report like this. It's fair to ask how mortality is estimated, how benefit-cost analysis is done, when developed countries (like Canada) hit diminishing returns on additional air pollution measures, and all that. But pollution levels are so high in countries like China and India, one doesn't really have to ask whether reducing the pollution levels they experience is worth its costit most likely is.Still, warts and all, it's great to see at least some of our environmental debate return to what is probably the world's greatest environmental challenge: getting clean air to the billions who suffer without it. The IEA is to be complimented on its timely new report, and its restoring conventional air pollution control to its proper place in international policy.""",,0_0

The data here mirror instrumental climate records from Fennoscandia for example, which also show over the last 250 years positive temperature trends and increasing early summer Siberian temperature reconstructions.

(iii) The decision by seabirds to abandon their traditional nesting grounds in the Midriff is compounded by the fishing effort during the previous season, which further increases the proportion of Elegant Terns migrating away from the Gulf of California.",,0_0

Bearing acres are estimated at 28.0 thousand. California experienced an adequate number of chilling hours, thus benefiting the Freestone crop. Freezing temperatures hit California in early March, which resulted in frost damage in some areas. Frost damage, along with a decrease in the bearing acres, have resulted in a forecasted lower production for the 2009 crop. How is America going to end?

"Chicago--July 22, 2004: Yesterday, the debate over climate change reached a new low as attorneys general in eight states--all Democrats but one--and the corporation counsel for New York City sued five electric utilities for their alleged role in causing global warming.""The lawsuit is frivolous. Evidence of a human role in climate change is slim and constantly being challenged in scholarly journals. There has been no warming trend in the U.S. or in any of the eight states participating in the lawsuit.There is no evidence of any harm caused by whatever ""global warming"" may have occurred (according to some temperature measures) during the past century. Most of that warming has taken place in the coldest areas of the planet and at night, creating a more benign environment for plant and animal life. The best estimates of the net economic impact of the warming predicted by computer models show a small benefit--thanks to lower prices for energy, forestry products, and food--and unequivocal benefits to human health and longevity.For all these reasons, forcing five electric utilities to lower their greenhouse gas emissions would not affect global temperatures or weather in the U.S., and so would not provide any benefit or relief to the plaintiffs.Why, if this is the case, has this suit been filed? Chris Horner in a statement released by the Competitive Enterprise Institute says, ""This is grandstanding, pure and simple. That many of these officials are involved in one way or another in John Kerry's campaign also provides the whiff of a political favor being provided to the Democratic contender, gaining headlines for an issue with which the Bush administration is clearly uncomfortable.""NCPA Senior Fellow H. Sterling Burnett notes that many of the states involved in the suit have already increased their energy costs by adopting alternative energy mandates and conservation mandates, making their states less attractive to new business investment than other states. ""This is merely an attempt to level the economic playing field by forcing the rest of the nation to adopt their high-cost energy mandates,"" says Burnett.Finally, one wonders if this isn't one more desperation ploy by the beleaguered global warming alarmists, who in recent years have lost the political debate over Kyoto and McCain-Lieberman, the scientific debate in the leading academic journals, and according to polls, the support of the American public as well. Maybe by taking the issue to the courts, they can get lucky and find a jury willing to ignore the data and punish some big corporations?

Breaking: CO2 allegedly causing Yellowstone grizzly population to only expand 4 to 5 percent per year BOZEMAN, Mont. (AP) Hunters are killing grizzly bears in record numbers around Yellowstone National Park and researchers say the once-endangered predator is expanding across the region . Bears are being seen and killed in places where they were absent for decades . Researchers suspect climate change is wiping out one of the bear's food sources and they worry the trend will continue as the animals roam farther in search of food. Yellowstone's 600 grizzlies were removed from the endangered species list in 2007 , following a recovery program that cost more than $20 million. If the death rate stays high for a second consecutive year, that would trigger a review of the bear's endangered status. ... Schwartz and other biologists who study grizzlies insist the population in the 15,000-square-mile Yellowstone region of Montana, Idaho and Wyoming remains strong for now, growing on average 4 to 5 percent a year. Yet they acknowledge climate change could prove the wild card that puts that growth in check. An epidemic of beetles in Yellowstone's high country has laid waste to tens of thousands of acres of whitebark pine trees, which have seeds that some grizzlies rely on as a dietary staple.""",,0_0

"Review of Energy Freedom, by Marita Littauer Noon (Intermedia Publishing Group 2011), 177 pages, ISBN- 978-1937654054If you are looking for a book that will fully explain why affordable, reliable energy is absolutely crucial to our social and economic well-being, Energy Freedom by Marita Littauer Noon is the book for you. This is truly one of the most enjoyable books I have read in a very long time.I am not alone in my assessment.John Fund, columnist for the Wall Street Journal, said of this book, Even people who have no idea where the electricity that lights their home or gas that cooks their meals comes from will find Energy Freedom a clear, understandable primer on why we all have to care about energy.""Marita Noon's Energy Freedom documents both the role energy plays in the exercise of American freedom and the efforts by some to subvert that freedom through restricting its supply,"" said Apollo 17 astronaut and former U.S. Senator Harrison Schmitt.Both these men are entirely correct.Progress Through Energy AdvancesIn a thorough but very readable narrative, Noon explains how and why so many people work to bring us affordable energy. She also lifts the veil on the dark side of energy politics, where anti-energy extremists pull out all the stops to restrict energy production and consumers' energy use. Indeed, she slays the ""green"" monster that warps the thinking of some of the most intelligent people in politics, and she explains how government regulation and red tape have prevented access to so many of our vast natural resourcesNoon details how life would be with only electric cars and limited transportation, comparing it to the pre-1920s when Americans rode on horseback. Sure, there were no direct carbon dioxide emissions from transportation (other than horses' breathing), but each horse required five acres of hay and oats to feed it, and the horses left piles of manure on city streets which created great stench and spread disease. The unintended environmental and health impacts of conventional energy substitutes may have changed over the years, but they remain in one form or another, regardless of how environmental activists choose to frame the issue.Noon describes an environmental dystopia where the medicines that have helped double our life spans in the past century would be drastically curtailed by reduced availability of cheap energy.Noon understands and agrees that we all want a green earthclean air, fresh water, and a safe food supplybut restricting energy use and blocking technological progress are not good ways to achieve it. We have made huge environmental strides since the dawn of the industrial Revolution. Despite dramatic increases in population, economic production, electricity generation, transportation miles, etc., U.S. aggregate emissions are less than half of what they were just a few decades ago.When someone on a street corner or in front of a grocery store asks us to sign a petition to stop plans for a new power plant or some other natural resource project, we ought to remember the larger implications of the environmental utopia they seek, Noon notes.Unmasking Environmental ExtremistsShe pulls no punches in linking today's environmental zealots to the authoritarian leftists of the early and mid-twentieth century. Noon gives full documentation why many people correctly refer to today's environmental activist groups as ""watermelons""green on the outside, red (Communist) underneath. She quotes George Will explaining, ""today's green left is the old red revised.... The left exists to enlarge the state's supervision of life, narrowing the individual choices in the name of the collective good.""Noon provides support for her points with detailed case studies, such as the nefarious ways of the seemingly innocuous Humane Society. Noon gives readers all the information we need to find and read the detailed case studies ourselves, which is a huge plus.Noon also provides excellent information and data on the most dangerous environmental groups, such as their astonishing net worth. For example, the World Wildlife Fund, which is number three on the list, has a net worth of $426 million. Collectively, numbers two through 10 on the list are worth $2.6 trillion. The number one group on the list, the Nature Conservancy, is worth more than $5 trillion. Even groups ranking relatively low on the list have astonishing resources at their command. The number 7 group, the Natural Resources Defense Council, is worth $232 million. Number 8, Environmental Defense, is worth $145 million.Topics that Stand OutThe book does an excellent job slaying misconceptions on many energy-related topics, and a few deserve special praise. Noon emphatically and persuasively documents the farce of ""free"" solar energy. She meticulously explains the absurdity of burning crops to make ethanol and biofuels, documenting the vast amounts of land and resources required to divert our food supply into fuel.Providing context for energy-related environmental hoaxes, Noon succinctly conveys the deadly historical effects that followed the false DDT claims. She also documents the tragic economic toll on northwestern U.S. communities resulting from efforts to save the non-endangered spotted owl. Far greater economic costs are being imposed on the United States and western democracies in the name of fighting a nonexistent global warming problem.Energy Freedom is both a thorough book and an easy read. It will make a great Christmas stocking stuffer.""",,0_0

"Radiation calculaions in global numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate models are usually performed in 3-hourly time intervals in order to reduce the computational cost. This treatment can lead to an incorrect Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) at the Earth's surface, which could be one of the error sources in modelled convection and precipitation. In order to improve the simulation of the diurnal cycle of GHI at the surface a fast scheme has been developed in this study and it can be used to determine the GHI at the Earth's surface more frequently with affordable costs. The scheme is divided into components for clear-sky and cloudy-sky conditions. The clear-sky component has been described in part I. The cloudy-sky component is introduced in this paper. The scheme has been tested using observations obtained from three Atmospheric Radiation Measurements (ARM) stations established by the U. S. Department of Energy. The results show that a half hourly mean relative error of GHI under all-sky conditions is less than 7\%. An important application of the scheme is in global climate models. The radiation sampling error due to infrequent radiation calculations is investigated using the this scheme and ARM observations. It is found that these errors are very large, exceeding 800 W m -2 at many non-radiation time steps due to ignoring the effects of clouds. Use of the current scheme can reduce these errors to less than 50 W m -2",,0_0

So a pollutant must be something that is not only emitted, but something that renders the air impure, which can hardly be said of carbon dioxide. Justice Antonin Scalia's dissent commented: ""It follows that everything airborne, from Frisbees to flatulence, qualifies as an ""air pollutant.' This reading of the statute defies common sense."" Marlo Lewis of the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) observes that any other interpretation also makes the ""precursor"" sentence redundant, because if everything emitted is an air pollutant, then precursors would be pollutants automatically. The Court brushed aside this perfectly conventional (and correct) argument from statutory interpretation, finding the statute ""unambiguous"" in its meaning that anything emitted is a pollutant.

With such intense demand for the genetically engineered variety, sugar beet breeders have cut back substantially on their production of conventional seeds, meaning that beet growers cannot easily switch back to conventional varieties because supplies of seed are inadequate.

Using law enforcement authority to resolve a public policy debate undermines the trust invested in our offices and threatens free speech.We are concerned that our colleagues' investigation undermines the trust the people have invested in Attorneys General to investigate fraud. Investigatory subpoenas were issued to at least one company and one non-profit believed to have made statements minimizing the risks of climate change. At the press conference, one of our colleagues noted that ""e are pursuing this as we would any other fraud matter.""

To accomplish this, Davies has recruited the group Campaign Against Political Correctness (CAPC) to consult on his planned reforms. A spokesman for the CAPC, John Midgley, said that ""people are crying out"" for an end to the wave of politically correct policies in Britain. ""We commissioned a survey by ICM,"" Midgley said, ""that said 80 per cent of people are fed up to the back teeth with it."" Davies promised to end council funding for ""politically correct initiatives"" and to ""scrap politically correct non-jobs"" such as ""community cohesion officers"" and ""encourage the former employees to seek meaningful employment."" In his first week in office, Davies fulfilled his promises by cutting his own salary from 73,000 to 30,000; reducing the number of councillors from 63 to 21, saving the town 800,000 a year. He immediately announced plans to reduce council tax by 3 per cent and got rid of the mayoral limousine.

"A coalition of environmental advocacy groups is pushing for the implementation of a federally financed environmentalist agenda in the curricula of all public schools.The benign-sounding No Child Left Inside Act, HB 3036, won U.S. House of Representatives approval on a 294-109 vote September 19, with only one Democrat (Rep. Brad Ellsworth of Indiana) opposed and two ranking Republicans on the Education Committee (Reps. Howard McKeon of California and Michael Castle of Delaware) in support.Congress went into fall recess before the Senate acted on the measure, but the bill could be integrated with the No Child Left Behind reauthorization next year or attached to a spending bill in the post-election lame-duck session.Two dozen environmental groups, led by the Sierra Club and Chesapeake Bay Foundation, are lobbying for the measure, which would award grants for integrating environmentalist precepts into curricula, academic standards, and teacher preparation.The money could go not just to school districts but to the very nonprofit advocacy organizations working to pass the bill.Objectivity Voted DownBy a 230-172 vote, the House rejected an amendment proposed by Rep. Tom Price (R-GA) that would have barred lobbying groups from receiving the grants and would have sought scientific accuracy and balance in what students were taught about the environment through the funded programs.The coalition's Web site, hosted by the Chesapeake Bay group, indicates the slant it would seek in classrooms by defining the problem"" as, among other things, climate change, childhood obesity, and something called ""nature-deficit disorder.""That is a term author Richard Louv coined in his book Last Child in the Woods, where he argued children are losing touch with the natural world and hence becoming vulnerable to maladies such as attention deficit disorder, depression, and obesity.The theory is an intriguing (if unproven) one, but should Washington take over from parents, churches, and community groups the task of taking kids out on hikes to commune with nature?Humans BlamedAs for climate change, the coalition asserts, ""the issue of global climate change requires Americans to understand the human-created challenges facing our world and the options facing our nation moving forward. It is projected that major societal change will be needed in response to global warming. To that end, each of us may be called upon to make changes to reduce the impact on the environment.""That statement assumes global warming is occurring as a result of the activities of man, and that drastic, mandatory changes in modern living will be necessary to curb it. Clearly, the federally funded curriculum would side with the forces led by former Vice President Al Gore falsely contending the science is settled on all this and no room exists for debate.If enacted, No Child Left Inside, the chief sponsor of which is Maryland Democrat Rep. John Sarbanes, would require state grant recipients to show how they were measuring ""student environmental literacy"" and instilling environmental know-how in teachers. Advocacy groups receiving grants would design their own evaluation and accountability plans.Important Story OverlookedIn a September 22 statement, EdWatch Action, a citizens group in Minnesota, called HB 3036 an ""unconstitutional expansion of the federal government into the realm of education that promotes unscientific, non-academic, politically correct environmental propaganda.""The environmental standards, curriculum, and programs funded by this bill that are to be put in every subject would take valuable time and resources from core academic issues,"" the group continued. ""The grants also promote programs that are supposed to teach bogus, subjective, and political concepts like self-esteem and environmental justice.""In an early autumn dominated by news of a mind-boggling $700 billion federal bailout of financial institutions, this effort to use federal power to mandate environmentalist indoctrination throughout the nation's classrooms received little ink or airtime.No Child Left Inside deserves a lot more attention in the context of the larger question of whether Americans should be able to choose the kinds of schools they want for their children or have to accept the standardized, politicized versions mandated by politicians, bureaucrats, and interest groups.Robert Holland (rholland@heartland.org) is senior fellow for education policy with The Heartland Institute.""",,0_0

The debate takes place at Lake Delton, Wisconsin, part of the popular Wisconsin Dells tourist area.The request for Heartland to participate in this debate was prompted by an op-ed by James Taylor, managing editor of Environment & Climate News, that noted the recent decline in big-city recycling operations and how this was an illustration of the economic pitfalls of mandatory recycling. The op-ed was printed in several newspapers around the country and came to the attention of the head of AROW, who was not pleased by Taylor's statements.Later in January, Lehr will visit Winnipeg, Canada to address a meeting of the Manitoba Agriculture & Food Association, part of a four-day whirlwind of events that includes meetings with civic leaders and local lawmakers.

He is on the program for ""Preserving the American Dream,"" a conference for supporters of mobility and homeownership, taking place in Washington, DC on February 23-25. Heartland is a cosponsor, along with The Thoreau Institute, The Heritage Foundation, and several other organizations. Conference cosponsors promise the eventwill help you effectively oppose rail transit boondoggles, high-density urban zoning, restrictions on rural property rights, and other so-called smart-growth' policies. It may also lead to the creation of an American Dream Coalition that will promote free-market solutions to urban problems.The conference will take place at the Wyndham City Center Hotel in Washington, DC.
