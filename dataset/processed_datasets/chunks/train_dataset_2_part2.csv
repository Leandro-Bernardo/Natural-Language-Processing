Applying the CMIP5 TCRs to the changes in CO 2 concentration and other drivers of climate change from the first part of this century up to 20812100, expressed as the increase in total ERF, explains most of the projected rises in global temperature on the business-as-usual RCP8.5 scenario, although the relationship varies from model to model.

During the next 50 years, the recession of over half of the glaciers stopped, and many tidewater glaciers actually began to advance. These glacial stabilizations and advances were attributed by the authors to observed increases in precipitation and/or decreases in temperature. In the four decades since 1961, for example, weather stations at Novaya Zemlya show summer temperatures to have been 0.3 to 0.5C colder than those of the prior 40 years, while winter temperatures have been between 2.3 to 2.8C colder than they were over the prior 40-year period.

Thus the costs should have been averaged over the next 43 years rather than the next two centuries. Since the model Sir Nicholas used projects much higher global economic output in the 22nd century than in the 21st, the effect of paying for emissions reductions between now and 2050 is a massive re-distribution of wealth from the current relatively poor generation to much wealthier future generations.

"Now predicting the exact date of the next Bond Event could be a bit hard. Some folks count the L.I.A. as the last one, but I think it was a Half Bond event . That would make Bond 1 the start of The Dark Ages in 540 AD and put the Bond Event Zero at 1470+540= 2010 AD or so start date. Just about the time the sun went quiet (or 2040 AD if you use a 1500 year pulse). Or right about now. Do realize that D.O. Events are warming often preceding a cold plunge. A related thing is the Heinrich Event that is similar but shows ice rafted debris when still in a cold phase. Bond Events catch the cold plunge after the warm, during interglacials. So one reasonable surmise is that the recent warming period from 1970 to now was just a D.O. event, before the Bond Event drop.",SUBJ,1_2

Oceans are usually driven by wind drag, but the resulting power input has already been dissipated by the models drag parameterization in the atmospheric boundary layer. So this should be quite an inconsistency in the coupling of models, with effects on the turbulent fluxes.

UK geographers John Pethick at Newcastle University and Julian Orford at Queens University Belfast reported last year that water levels at some spots in the most vulnerable southwest are much higher than expected. They concluded that embankments along hundreds of tidal channels, some of which reach hundreds of kilometres inland, have vastly reduced the area of land covered by water at high tide. Because the water is less able to spread out, it shoots farther inland where it can. The result is a huge increase in tidal range in less-protected areas. Tide-gauge records from three locations in the southwest suggest a mean rate of relative sea-level rise of about 5 millimetres per year over the past 30 years, but some local spots have experienced an average annual high-water-level increase of 1520 millimetres.",OBJ,0_0

"2) Why Do Some Scientists Say It?s Cooling, while Others Say that Warming is Even Accelerating? Since there is so much year-to-year (and even decade-to-decade) variability in global average temperatures, whether it has warmed or cooled depends upon how far back you look in time. For instance, over the last 100 years, there was an overall warming which was stronger toward the end of the 20th Century. This is why some say ?warming is accelerating?. But if we look at a shorter, more recent period of time, say since the record warm year of 1998, one could say that it has cooled in the last 10-12 years.
