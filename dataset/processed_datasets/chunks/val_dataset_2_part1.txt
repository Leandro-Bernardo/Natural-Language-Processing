The first thing that should enter anyones mind after reading that is: what caused the big jumps in global surface temperatures? Dr. Trenberth identified when they happened: before 1977, around 1986/87, and after 1996. But Dr. Trenberth failed to explain them. On the other hand, for four years, I have been presenting and discussing the natural, not anthropogenic, causes of those big jumps. Thats right, Dr. Trenberth admitted to periods of no warming between big jumps, and the data show the big jumps are caused naturally. One might think that undermines the hypothesis that manmade greenhouse gases caused most of the global warming over the last 3 decades. I dont believe that was Dr. Trenberths intent with his article, but as you will see, thats what it suggests.",,2_1

"Lindzens hypothesis was that high altitude tropical cirrus results from remnant moisture detrained from towering cumulonimbus clouds (convection cell thunderstorms). Depending on a lot of complicated cloud microphysics, a warmer sea surface could produce more massive convection cells containing more moisture, which would precipitate more rainfall, leaving less upper troposphere residual moisture detraining to form warming cirrus. So the proportions of upper troposphere dry and moist regions would counter-intuitively change as SST warmed in favor of dryand less cirrus. Hence there would be an adaptive infrared iris where warmer sea surfaces would produce via intermediate tropospheric convection and precipitation processes less cirrus, and therefore a net negative tropical cloud feedback.

"Two, the very large climate modeling overestimates of global warming are primarily a result of the assumed positive water-vapor feedback processes (about 2 o C extra global warming with a CO 2 doubling in most models). Models assume any upper tropospheric warming also brings about upper tropospheric water-vapor increase as well, because they assume atmospheric relative humidity (RH) remains quasi-constant. But measurements and theoretical considerations of deep cumulonimbus (Cb) convective clouds indicate any increase of CO 2 and its associated increase in global rainfall would lead to a reduction of upper tropospheric RH and a consequent enhancement (not curtailment) of Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) to space.",,5_1

So why would a trace gas be so crucial? And when did carbon dioxide go from irrelevant to the dominant driver of climate? (For example: past geological records indicate carbon dioxide levels in excess of 7,000 ppm and no correlation with temperature; Gore's famous graph where carbon dioxide lags behind temperature changes by 800 years; and, the more recent disconnects of carbon dioxide levels from temperature changes throughout the past century).",,2_3

"Nature absorbs 98.5% of the CO 2 that is emitted by nature and man. As CO 2 increases in the atmosphere, nature causes plant growth to increase via photosynthesis which is an endothermic (cooling) reaction. For every pound of biomass formed some 10,000 Btu are removed from the atmosphere. CO 2 is absorbed, and oxygen is liberated. Further, a doubling of CO 2 will increase the photosynthesis rate by 30 to 100%, depending on temperature and available moisture 8 . More CO 2 is absorbed by the plants due to the increased concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere available for conversion to carbohydrates. Nature therefore has in place a built-in mechanism to regulate the CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere that will always completely dwarf man's feeble attempts to regulate it. Further, no regulation is necessary because CO 2 is not a pollutant; it is part of the animal-plant life cycle. Without it, life would not exist on earth.",,3_3

SSTs have also likely warmed a bit from anthropogenic enhancements to the earths greenhouse effect. And these elevated SSTs may be having an impact on Atlantic hurricanes (see for example our recent paper published in Geophysical Research Letters (Michaels et al., 2006) which is available here ).

"Abstract. The recent slowdown in global warming has brought into question the reliability of climate model projections of future temperature change and has led to a vigorous debate over whether this slowdown is the result of naturally occurring, internal variability or forcing external to Earths climate system. To address these issues, we applied a semi-empirical approach that combines climate observations and model simulations to estimate Atlantic- and Pacific-based internal multidecadal variability (termed AMO and PMO, respectively). Using this method, the AMO and PMO are found to explain a large proportion of internal variability in Northern Hemisphere mean temperatures. Competition between a modest positive peak in the AMO and a substantially negative-trending PMO are seen to produce a slowdown or false pause in warming of the past decade.",,5_1

"Within six days after planting, photosynthetic rates of second leaves of CO 2 -enriched plants were 37% greater than those of second leaves of ambiently-grown plants. This CO 2 -induced photosynthetic enhancement slowly declined over the growing season, stabilizing around 15% for the time period between 23 and 60 days after planting. In addition, when measuring photosynthetic rates at reduced oxygen concentrations of 2%, the authors observed 16 and 9% increases in photosynthesis for ambient and CO 2 -enriched plants, respectively, indicating that elevated CO 2 was reducing photorespiratory carbon losses. Even so, this phenomenon could not fully account for the CO 2 -induced stimulation of photosynthesis.

(It is possible that per-capita CO2 emissions were never this low even before the advent of widespread fossil fuel use, as wood burning by Americans in the nineteenth century may have produced more than 2.4 tons of CO2 per capita. Much depends on the emissions coefficient for wood burning and how, since wood is biomass rather than a fossil fuel, regrowth of forestland is credited in carbon accounting. In 1875, twice as much energy was generated from burning wood than fossil fuels.)",,0_0

Mark 1 Eyeball observations of FLL seasonal reef visibility are true everywhere. It is in the phytoplankton genes. That means more oxygen, more marine food chain food, and more carbon sequestration if waters warm. Second, temperature up-regulated gene expression shifts phytoplankton metabolic pathways away from phosphorus and toward nitrogen. This is a marvelous example of evolutionary adaptation. Phosphorus is a growth-limiting factor in most ocean regions, provided primarily by upwelling deep water. A shift toward N-limitation with more bioactivity avoids the phosphorus growth constraint. Oceans have their own nitrogen fixation mechanisms (e.g. cyanobacteria like Trichodesmium ) that would also get more productive. Less phosphorus consumed by phytoplankton means more is available to N-fixing cyanobacteria. ,",,3_2

The misrepresentation of ENSO dynamics in such models may preclude an accurate separation of dynamic and thermodynamic coupling effects.

U.S. Climate Data Reveals Past Global Warming Far Exceeds Modern Temperature Change,,2_1
"It seems probable that 2010 will be in terms of global annual average temperature statistically identical to the annual temperatures of the past decade. Some eminent climatologists, such as Professor Phil Jones of the University of East Anglias Climatic Research Unit, suggest the global annual average temperatures havent changed for the past 15 years. We are reaching the point where the temperature standstill is becoming the major feature of the recent global warm period that began in 1980. In brief, the global temperature has remained constant for longer than it has increased. Perhaps this should not be surprising as in the seven decades since 1940 the world has gotten warmer in only two of them, and if one considers each decade individually the increase in temperature in each has barely been statistically significant. Only when the warming in the 1980s is added to that of the first half of the 1990s does the change exceed the noise in the system.",,1_4

This being the case, it can be appreciated that plant growth is not only enhanced by CO 2 -induced increases in photosynthesis during the light period of the day, they are also enhanced by CO 2 -induced decreases in respiration during the dark period.
