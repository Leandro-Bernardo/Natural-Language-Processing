Depending on a lot of complicated cloud microphysics, a warmer sea surface could produce more massive convection cells containing more moisture, which would precipitate more rainfall, leaving less upper troposphere residual moisture detraining to form warming cirrus. So the proportions of upper troposphere dry and moist regions would counter-intuitively change as SST warmed in favor of dryand less cirrus. Hence there would be an adaptive infrared iris where warmer sea surfaces would produce via intermediate tropospheric convection and precipitation processes less cirrus, and therefore a net negative tropical cloud feedback.

"Economic Productivity and Competitiveness top priorities for the Obama administration and the Harper government, can be boosted by natural gas abundance. Even as prices remain affordable, natural gas utilities in both countries are leaders in promoting energy efficiency for consumers, lowering the input cost of energy and making a range of outputs from the private sector less expensive to produce and lowering energy bills so that consumers have more to spend elsewhere. The best of these ideas are worth sharing. One especially promising development is an array of new technologies enabling natural gas to become a transportation fuel for cars, trucks, rail and marine transport transportation accounts for roughly 25 per cent of U.S. and Canadian energy consumption according to the Energy Information Agency, and lower costs for transportation fuels will help improve competitiveness in logistics while reducing GHG emissions (compared to petroleum based fuels).",OBJ,0_0

"Nature absorbs 98.5% of the CO 2 that is emitted by nature and man. As CO 2 increases in the atmosphere, nature causes plant growth to increase via photosynthesis which is an endothermic (cooling) reaction. For every pound of biomass formed some 10,000 Btu are removed from the atmosphere. CO 2 is absorbed, and oxygen is liberated. Further, a doubling of CO 2 will increase the photosynthesis rate by 30 to 100%, depending on temperature and available moisture 8 . More CO 2 is absorbed by the plants due to the increased concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere available for conversion to carbohydrates. Nature therefore has in place a built-in mechanism to regulate the CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere that will always completely dwarf man's feeble attempts to regulate it. Further, no regulation is necessary because CO 2 is not a pollutant; it is part of the animal-plant life cycle. Without it, life would not exist on earth.",OBJ,3_3

"The heliosphere, and the termination shock sphere within it, deflects cosmic radiation. The Earths geomagnetic field also deflects cosmic radiation. The strength of the heliosphere depends on the Suns activity levels. High levels of solar activity reduce the volume of cosmic rays entering the Earths atmosphere, contributing to global warming. High levels of solar activity generate more turbulence in the heliosphere scattering galactic cosmic rays before they reach the inner planets. Conversely, a greater volume of cosmic rays enter our atmosphere during times of low solar activity because the Heliospheric magnetic fields are smoother with less scattering of galactic cosmic rays, resulting in global cooling.",OBJ,2_1

"Abstract. The recent slowdown in global warming has brought into question the reliability of climate model projections of future temperature change and has led to a vigorous debate over whether this slowdown is the result of naturally occurring, internal variability or forcing external to Earths climate system. To address these issues, we applied a semi-empirical approach that combines climate observations and model simulations to estimate Atlantic- and Pacific-based internal multidecadal variability (termed AMO and PMO, respectively). Using this method, the AMO and PMO are found to explain a large proportion of internal variability in Northern Hemisphere mean temperatures. Competition between a modest positive peak in the AMO and a substantially negative-trending PMO are seen to produce a slowdown or false pause in warming of the past decade.",OBJ,5_1

Even so, this phenomenon could not fully account for the CO 2 -induced stimulation of photosynthesis.

(It is possible that per-capita CO2 emissions were never this low even before the advent of widespread fossil fuel use, as wood burning by Americans in the nineteenth century may have produced more than 2.4 tons of CO2 per capita.

It is intended for persons (with or without technical backgrounds) interested in learning about El Nio and La Nia events and in understanding the natural causes of the warming of our global oceans for the past 30 years. Because land surface air temperatures simply exaggerate the natural warming of the global oceans over annual and multidecadal time periods, the vast majority of the warming taking place on land is natural as well. The book is the product of years of research of the satellite-era sea surface temperature data thats available to the public via the internet.

Mark 1 Eyeball observations of FLL seasonal reef visibility are true everywhere. It is in the phytoplankton genes. That means more oxygen, more marine food chain food, and more carbon sequestration if waters warm. Second, temperature up-regulated gene expression shifts phytoplankton metabolic pathways away from phosphorus and toward nitrogen. This is a marvelous example of evolutionary adaptation. Phosphorus is a growth-limiting factor in most ocean regions, provided primarily by upwelling deep water. A shift toward N-limitation with more bioactivity avoids the phosphorus growth constraint. Oceans have their own nitrogen fixation mechanisms (e.g. cyanobacteria like Trichodesmium ) that would also get more productive. Less phosphorus consumed by phytoplankton means more is available to N-fixing cyanobacteria. ,",OBJ,3_2

The time frame of the projected climate change was longer than earlier green crusades, typically from 50 to 100 years.

That provides the dipole moment necessary for interaction with electromagnetic radiation. At very low atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 a large percentage of the available energy radiated by the Earth in this 14.77band is already affected leaving very little energy for increased CO 2 concentrations to affect.

In practice, however, as you rightly point out, the likelihood is that more water vapor in the atmosphere will lead to the formation of more clouds. And it is here that the UN's analysis goes completely astray. For it makes no allowance for the additional cloud-albedo effect that these clouds generated by the water-vapor feedback will create. This leads to a catastrophic overvaluation by the IPCC of the water-vapor feedback; and, though this is partly compensated for by the treatment of all cloud albedo as a forcing, it creates an overstatement of the final warming effect of adding greenhouse gases such as CO2 to the atmosphere after all feedbacks have been taken into account.",SUBJ,3_1

Given a little more seasonal warmth, it would disappear altogether each February.?? But it doesn't.?? It continues to slowly but surely grow in the mean. Reviewed 11 May 2005",SUBJ,1_1

One approach is to look at the most recent periods of cooling and project those as possibilities (1) the 1945-1975cooling, (2) the 1880-1915 cooling, (3) the Dalton cooling (1790-1820), (4) the Maunder cooling (1650-1700). I appended the temperature record for the 1945-1975 cooling to the temperature curve beginning in 2000 to see what this might look like (see below). If the cooling turns out to be deeper, reconstructions of past temperatures suggest 0.3C cooler for the 1880-1915 cooling, about 0.7C for the Dalton cooling (square), and about 1.2C for the Maunder cooling (circle).

As California's economy and population have grown, so have the state's aggregate electricity consumption and emissions. Today, California consumes 65 percent more electricity than it did in 1980. Coal-based electricity imports from other states grew by 60 percent from 1983 to 2005, and is now 10 percent of California's total generation, growing from 9 percent in 1983.

When the winds shift, that thicker ice is blown out past Svalbard into the north Atlantic, and is replaced by thinner, first-year ice that more readily melts each summer. The amount of multi-year ice in the Arctic is controlled by the direction of the winds and the Arctic oscillation. 2 It was not warmer temperatures that removed the thickest Arctic Ice, but sub-freezing winds blowing from the coldest regions in the northern hemisphere. 4,5",OBJ,1_1

In particular, the parameterization of boundary layer stratus clouds has proved to be very difficult and has been a major area of research in the last decade. These clouds have a very weak greenhouse effect, but strongly reflect incoming shortwave radiation, thus modulating the albedo of the Earth. Bony and Dufresne (2005) have shown that the simulation of marine low level clouds is a large source of uncertainty in tropical cloud feedbacks and of climate sensitivity, suggesting that the simulation of tropical responses to different forcings will strongly depend on the parameterization of these clouds, and that results need to be tested using different cloud schemes.",OBJ,5_1

Nevertheless, even with the assumptions ceded, declining discount rates cannot be used with the IAMs as set up in the IWG's analysis.
